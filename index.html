							Lots of battles began with a cavalry charge.
						</div>
						<div id>
							During a cavalry charge, gunners took shelter behind pikemen. (Carried 12-18 feet long pikes.)
						</div>
						An army unfortunately had to fight in the open and close together because it would have gotten too smoky in a forest, and the generals could not tell the troops what to do.

					Lincoln took control of all the telegraphs so nobody could spy on them and send information.

					<br>
					The "Pennsylvania Boys" dug a mine shaft under a confederate fort protecting Petersburg and blew it up.
					<br>
					William T. Sherman sabotaged the South by taking food, burning buildings, and freeing slaves in Atlanta. (A southern town)

					<h1>A Strategic Battle</h1>
					<h2>Gettysburg</h2>
					<img src="assets/gettysburg.png">
					<ul class="gettysburg">
						<p>Day 2 of the Battle of Gettysburg</p>
						The entire battle lasted three days.
						<br>
						It was considered by some as the most important engagement during the Civil War.
						<br>
						During the second day, the Union forces made a fishhook like position so they could easily reinfore any place that was in trouble.
						<br>
						The hill Little Round Top protected the Union's left flank and if they lost it, they would have been surrounded.
						<br>
						Union soldiers arrived at Little Round Top just before the Confederate soliders did.
